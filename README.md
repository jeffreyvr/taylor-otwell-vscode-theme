# README

This theme is based on the [Laravel Github - Classic theme](https://github.com/victorze/vscode-theme-laravel/blob/master/themes/github_clasic.json). A couple of edits are made to try and get as close as possible to Laravel creator Taylor Otwell's Inspired Github theme which he uses in SublimeText.

## Installation

Code copy the folder into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.

## Additional suggestions

Make sure to set up a pretty large line height and font size. As font, I believe Taylor uses Operator Mono but recently I have seen another font being used. I personally like Cascadia Code Mono a lot.

**Enjoy!**
